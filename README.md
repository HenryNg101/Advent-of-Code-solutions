# Advent of Code solutions

You can find each year solutions in the directory that has that year.

How to run code: Just create a `cookies.json` file in the top directory, then paste your cookie info into the file, something looks like this:

```json
{
    "_ga": "...",
    "_gid": "...",
    "session": "..."
}
```

Then, create Python virtual environment and install needed modules in `requirements.txt` file. That's all, then just run a notebook as you wish

Note: Only files of days and parts I have done works, other just are drafts, pls don't run.
