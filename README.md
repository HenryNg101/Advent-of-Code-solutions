# Advent of Code solutions

You can find each year solutions in the directory that has that year.

How to run code: Just change your `session` value in file `inputGetter.py` to your own cookie's `session` value. Then, create Python virtual environment and install needed modules in `requirements.txt` file. That's all, then just run a notebook as you wish

Note: Only files of days and parts I have done works, other just are drafts, pls don't run.
