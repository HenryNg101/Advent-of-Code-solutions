# Advent of Code solutions

You can find each year solutions in the directory that has that year.

Each day has 2 parts, so I separated them into part a and b, or merge them together (meaning that I have been able to to get solutions for both parts from one code file)

How to run code for each challenge:

- Download input file, save the file's name as `input` (with out any extension) in same directory as the file you want to run.
- Run command `g++ -o out <filename>.cpp; ./out` (for C++ files), `python3 <filename>.py` (for Python files)
- Only files of days and parts I have done works, other just are drafts, pls don't run
