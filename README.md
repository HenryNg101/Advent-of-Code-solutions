# Advent of Code solutions

You can find each year solutions in the directory that has that year.

Each day has 2 parts, so I separated them into part a and b. E.g: Day 4 has 2 files `4a.cpp` and `4b.cpp`

How to run code for each challenge:

- Download input file, save the file's name as `input` in same directory as the file you want to run.
- Run command `g++ -o out <filename>.cpp; ./out` (for C++ files), `python3 <filename>.py` (for Python files)
